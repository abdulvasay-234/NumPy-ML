# Mean
* The sum of elements, along with an axis divided by the number of elements, is known 
as arithmetic mean. In other words it is the sum divided by the count.
* The numpy.mean() function is used to compute the arithmetic mean along the specified 
axis.
* This function returns the average of the array elements. By default, the average is taken on 
the flattened array.
