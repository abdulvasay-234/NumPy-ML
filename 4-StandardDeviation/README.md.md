# Standard deviation
* Its symbol is Ïƒ (sigma)
* It is the square root of the Variance.
* The numpy module of Python provides a function called numpy.std(), used to compute the 
standard deviation along the specified axis. This function returns the standard deviation of 
the array elements. 
* The square root of the average square deviation (computed from the mean), is known as the 
standard deviation. 
* By default, the standard deviation is calculated for the flattened array.
		Standard Deviation = sqrt (mean (abs(x-x.mean( ))**2
